# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?

    My approach was very trial and errror. I wasn't confident in my initial architecture diagram and how I wanted the classes to interact with eachother so I just implemented it how I had planned and then went from there. Actually coding each class made it clear to me that I had to rethink the relationship between classes. So I restructured my architecture diagram until I found a plan that actually worked and made sense. I implemented that and finally had success. Once the structure and relationships were established, actually coding the methods was more tedious than actually difficult. I also had multiple people game testing for me which helped me account for all the edge cases I had not previously thought of. 

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?

    One thing that I realized while I was coding was that I had sooooo many if else statements. So, I learned how to use switch statements to make my code a bit more consice. 

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?

    I know there are better ways I could have implemented the check location function. You gave me an alternative way in the feedback on my first draft codebase, but I was a little confused on how to implement it the way you told me to. Also wouldn't that be creating a new object for every single coordinate on the map? I wasn't sure if that would be more or less efficient than the way I had it so I just kept mine. 

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?

    I would definitely add more locations on the map and maybe add some items that can help speed up your progress. 

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?

    When I allowed my friends to play my game, I asked them "What's something you wish you could change" and one of them said to make more accepted user inputs. So for example, letting the user say "speak" as well as "talk" or saying "walk/fly" instead of "go". Also when you told me to put my check location method in the Map class a lot of things started to make sense to me.  

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?

    Review association! Also make sure to use your architecture diagram, it's more helpful than you think

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.

    I worked alone.
